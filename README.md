## Prerequisites
- Knowledge of Data Management API of Autodesk Platform Services (APS)
- Knowledge of .NET Framework and WinForms in C#
- Install Visual Studio (Windows version)
- Install .NET 8 Runtime [installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- Install [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) along with npm
- Install Webview2 Evergreen Runtime
- Create Autodesk APS app to get developer credentials. Visit [Autodesk Platform Sevices Portal](https://aps.autodesk.com), sign up for an account, then [create an app](https://aps.autodesk.com/myapps/create). For this new app, select the type of Web Application as this application will support both 2legged and 3legged authentication. Next input **http://localhost:8083/code** as Callback URL. Finally take note of the **client id** and **client secret**. 
- If you work with BIM360 or ACC, you will also need additional step to connect your APS App to the BIM360 or ACC account. Follow the [tutorial](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/getting-started/get-access-to-account/)

 ## Running Steps
1. Clone this project or download it. It's recommended to install [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com). To clone it via command line, use the following command line on Windows:

    ``git clone https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-hubs-bulk-files-manager.git``

2. Build the publish version of this application by the following commandline in the root solution folder (same folder of `bulk-file-manager.sln`). This will install required packages automatically and build distributable application at: \aps-hubs-bulk-files-manager\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows\win-x64\publish\

    ``dotnet publish -r win-x64``  

4. Run the application file `Bulk-File-Manager.exe`, it will launch the tool with login form. Please enter your APS **client id** and **client secret**. This activity will be conducted only once, as the application will save these details in the database for future authentication. If you have already setting file (json), click Import Settings to configure the setting.
